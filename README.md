# Guitar Tab To Piano Sheet Converter

## Motivation & Purpose
This is a project that converts guitar tabs with multiple instruments into a single piano sheet music document. <br>
Also generates midi piano files for guitar tabs.
As a piano player who loves listening to metal, certain songs only had guitar tabs, but no piano sheets music. <br> 
So what I'm saying is yes, the whole project happened because I wanted to play Blind Guardian on the piano 

## Example Results
